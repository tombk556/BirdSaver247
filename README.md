- Affine Transformation

An affine transformation is a mathematical operation that changes the size, shape, and position of objects in a plane while preserving straight lines and parallelism. It includes transformations like:
Translation: Moving an object without rotating it.
Scaling: Resizing an object.
Rotation: Turning an object around a point.
Shearing: Slanting the shape of an object.
When mapping pixel coordinates (from an image or screen) to GPS coordinates (real-world locations), you need to establish a relationship between the two coordinate systems. This is particularly useful in applications like augmented reality, geographic information systems (GIS), and navigation systems. Therefore we use affine transformations to map our camera pixel coordinate system to our gps coordinate system.
